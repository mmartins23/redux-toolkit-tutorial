### Redux Toolkit Tutorial - 17 - Redux Toolkit Intro

In the past 15 tutorials, we have delved into Redux, its core concepts, and the corresponding code implementations. While you may now feel comfortable with Redux, it's important to note that the way Redux code is written has evolved significantly as of 2022 and beyond. There are two main reasons for this shift, and understanding them will enhance your grasp of the concerns developers had with Redux.

**Concerns with Traditional Redux**:
1. **Boilerplate Code**:
   - Redux requires a substantial amount of boilerplate code.
   - For every state transition, you need to define an action type constant, an action object, an action creator, and use these in a reducer's switch statement.
   - In large-scale applications with numerous state transitions, this repetitive pattern can become quite tedious.

2. **Dependency on Multiple Packages**:
   - While simple state transitions can be handled with Redux alone, more complex scenarios require additional libraries:
     - **redux-thunk** for asynchronous actions.
     - **immer** for handling nested state updates.
     - **redux-devtools** for debugging Redux applications.
   - Managing these dependencies adds to the complexity of using Redux.

**Introduction to Redux Toolkit**:
- **Improving Developer Experience**:
  - The issues of excessive boilerplate and multiple dependencies led to the creation of Redux Toolkit.
  - Redux Toolkit is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
  - It abstracts the setup process and handles common use cases, allowing developers to focus more on application code.

- **Core Concepts and Benefits**:
  - Redux Toolkit simplifies the Redux setup and includes useful utilities.
  - If you are already familiar with the core concepts of Redux (store, state, actions, reducers), transitioning to Redux Toolkit will be straightforward.

**Next Steps**:
- In the upcoming videos, we will redevelop the cake and ice cream shop application using Redux Toolkit.
- This hands-on approach will help you clearly understand the advantages Redux Toolkit offers.

Stay tuned as we dive into Redux Toolkit and explore how it can enhance your development workflow. Let's get started in the next video!
