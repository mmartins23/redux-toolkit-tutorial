# Summary of Redux Toolkit Tutorial - 26 - Provider

In this Redux Toolkit tutorial, the focus is on integrating the Redux store with a React application using the `Provider` component from the `react-redux` library. Hereâ€™s a summary of the steps covered:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install `react-redux` using `npm install react-redux`.

2. **Configure Redux Store**:
   - Create and configure a Redux store using `configureStore` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`.
   - Combine multiple reducers (`cakeReducer`, `icecreamReducer`, `userReducer`) into a single store object.

3. **Set Up Provider**:
   - Import the `Provider` component from `react-redux`.
   - Import the configured Redux store from `./app/store.js`.
   - Wrap the root component (`App`) with the `Provider` component and pass the store as a prop.
   - Ensure that the `Provider` is placed at the top of the component tree to make the Redux store available throughout the app.

4. **Render Application**:
   - Use `ReactDOM.createRoot` to render the app with the `Provider` component, which allows the entire component tree to access the Redux store.

By following these steps, the React application is set up to interact with Redux, enabling components to read from and dispatch actions to the Redux store. The next steps in the tutorial will cover how to read values from the store and dispatch actions.
