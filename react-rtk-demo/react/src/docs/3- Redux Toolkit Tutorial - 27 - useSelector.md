In this Redux Toolkit tutorial, the focus is on using the `useSelector` hook to read data from the Redux store in React components. Here's a summary of the steps and explanations:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up Redux Store**:
    - Create a Redux store by combining multiple reducers (`cakeReducer`, `icecreamReducer`, `userReducer`) using `configureStore` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`.

    ```javascript
    import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
    import cakeReducer from '../features/cake/cakeSlice';
    import icecreamReducer from '../features/icecream/icecreamSlice';
    import userReducer from '../features/user/userSlice';

    const store = configureStore({
        reducer: {
            cake: cakeReducer,
            icecream: icecreamReducer,
            user: userReducer,
        },
        // middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => getDefaultMiddleware().concat(logger),
    });

    export default store;
    ```

2. **Integrate Redux Store with React App**:
    - Ensure the Redux store is available throughout the React application by wrapping the root component with the `Provider` component from `react-redux`.

    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux'; // Corrected import statement
    import store from './app/store.js';
    import App from './App.jsx';
    import './index.css';

    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
        <React.StrictMode>
            <Provider store={store}>
                <App />
            </Provider>
        </React.StrictMode>,
    );
    ```

3. **Use `useSelector` to Read Data from Store**:
    - Import the `useSelector` hook from `react-redux`.
    - Use `useSelector` within a component to access a specific piece of state from the Redux store.

4. **Example Component: CakeView**:
    - Create a `CakeView` component that reads the number of cakes from the store using `useSelector`.

    ```javascript
    import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

    const CakeView = () => {
        const numOfCakes = useSelector((state) => state.cake.numOfCakes);
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Number of cakes - {numOfCakes}</h2>
                <button>Order cake</button>
                <button>Restock cake</button>
            </div>
        );
    };

    export default CakeView;
    ```

5. **Example Component: IcecreamView**:
    - Similarly, create an `IcecreamView` component that reads the number of ice creams from the store using `useSelector`.

    ```javascript
    import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

    function IcecreamView() {
        const numOfIceCreams = useSelector((state) => state.icecream.numOfIceCreams);

        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Number of ice creams - {numOfIceCreams}</h2>
                <button>Order ice cream</button>
                <button>Restock ice creams</button>
            </div>
        );
    }

    export default IcecreamView;
    ```

### Explanation

- **`useSelector` Hook**: This hook is used to extract data from the Redux store state. It takes a selector function as an argument, which is called with the Redux state, and returns the desired piece of state.
- **Connecting Components to Store**: By using `useSelector`, components can subscribe to specific slices of the Redux state and re-render when that slice of state changes.
- **Provider Component**: The `Provider` component makes the Redux store available to any nested components that need to access the Redux state. It uses React's context API under the hood.

By following these steps, you can effectively read data from the Redux store in your React components using the `useSelector` hook.
